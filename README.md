Distributed Systems assignments about Master-Worker architecture along with their respective diagrams in the documentation:
- Task1 contains XMLRPC, Redis, GRPC and Hybrid (Redis + XMLRPC) implementations. Will probably add RabbitMQ soon.
- Task2 contains a modified version of the XMLRPC implementation with a dynamic membership protocol using Redis and failure detectors using sockets.
